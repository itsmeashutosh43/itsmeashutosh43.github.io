# Facebook Dilemma


**I do not have the taste of great music. I find morning birds annoying. I am 21 and I have been on Facebook for 10 years.** I am obliged to like songs my friends like. I am prone to favour the artists with more followers. I hate the players with more haters for no reason of my own.

*If there is one thing no one can satisfy, its human ego. And it is the exact selling spot for all social media.*

If our friends get 50 more likes on his profile picture we will show great diligence trying to turn the tables. This is a hyperloop we can never come out of.

While comparing our lifestyle with the pseudo life-style portrayed by our friends on Facebook, we conclude our life to be inferior to others. According to famous psychologist Dr. Joseph Murphy, if our body is a ship our mind is the captain.

**Can the ship withstand the tides if the captain is not motivated?**

Surely the creators thought connecting people would be great for mankind. I have time to watch videos on cats but I do not have time to spend time with my grandparents. Facebook is connecting with random people but they are disconnecting us with our real friends and families. I have not done a research on it, but I can say that.

I do not enjoy my food. I get jubilant if I get a good response about the food . I travel just to post photos on Instagram. I forget fatherâ€™s day but I remember to wish all my friends on their birthday. I am a Social Media Addict.

I know I am addict. I occasionally deactivate my account. I am hopeful that one day I need to contact one of the strangers who I met at one of the events. With this hope, I cannot delete my account either.

I am in a predicament to decide on how to proceed. Should I allow facebook to indirectly affect my life or should I delete everything and become a **modern era monk**?
